## Welcome :wave:

This repo is to track what we're learning for the TensorFlow.js Study Group.

For now, I'm going to be using [Gant Laborde's](https://twitter.com/gantlaborde)
[LEARNING TENSORFLOW.JS](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-tensorflowjs/9781492090786/) as a loose outline for the study group, which also goes along with my [livestreams](https://www.twitch.tv/bekahhw/) learning TFJS.

We can use the discussion boards as async communication for each week.

To register for the study group, please use [this link](lu.ma/quuo8vvv)
